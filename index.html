                <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
                <p>My name is Kevin, I'm 22 years old, 5'11, and I suck at biographies.
                I started off pursuing a Music Production degree as an undergrad at
                Irvine Valley College. I later entered a job that allowed me to pursue
                a career in IT networking. After realizing that wasn't the path for me I
                decided to join the military as a combat medic in the Army Reserve.
                When I came back from training I was introduced to HTML by my girlfriend
                at the time and I was hooked ever since.</p>
                <h2>Why Root 1?</h2>
                <p>I'm taking this root class in order to prep for the June cohort for the
               full immersion program. I'm also trying to improve on the HTML/CSS
               knowledge that I've already attained.</p>
                <h2>What Kind of Job Am I Looking For?</h2>
                <p>I'm really just trying to get an entry-level web development job anywhere,
               just to get my feet wet in the industry ad hopefully advance from there.</p>
                <h2>Why Web-Development Though?</h2>
                <p>I've never been an incredible student in terms of traditional schooling.
               If I'm not interested in the subject then I just won't be motivated to
               pass the class. Coding is something that generally interests me. It's
               something that I kind of have a knack for and there are nights where I
               fantasize about being a coder for a living more than a linebacker for
               the Raiders. Coding has by far been one of the most frustrating and yet
               rewarding and satisfying things I have ever tried my hand at and if I
               can make a career out of it and do it for the rest of my life then I'll
               take any opportunity I can get.</p>
